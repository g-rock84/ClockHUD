### What is it?
Clock HUD is a modification for the game Minecraft that that adds a simple clock to your heads up display.
### Use
Clock HUD is easy to use! Toggle the clock by pressing `,`, or whatever key you choose to map to Clock HUD.  
The size and position of the clock can be tweaked in the config file.

### Contributions
I welcome pull requests, especially bug fixes! If you feel so inclined to add a new feature, I recommend talking to me first, since I have a specific vision of which direction this mod should go, and I don't want people to waste their time coding something I won't implement.
